      <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">In the interactive processes between users and interfaces, new elements appear in the screens where signs are out of the users’ signification system. However, in each step to achieve completely a task, the users are inferring about the behaviour of the system interface to execute all activities successfully. These inferences and expectations, possibly predictions, may be frustrated by technical failure or by communication failures. In this case, users must infer again. Truths future envisaged by the user can be destroyed if it has any disruption in the communication process between user and the interface (or with the interface’s designer).
      <b>This preview of future state that influences the users’ decision-making by is called Anticipation.</b></p>
			
			<h4 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Principle: Bring to the user all the information and tools needed for each step of the process</h4>

      <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Software and hardware systems should attempt to anticipate the user’s wants and needs. Do not expect users to leave the current screen to search for and collect necessary information. Information must be in place and necessary tools present and visible.</p>

      <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Anticipation requires that designers have a deep understanding of both the task domain and the users in order to predict what will be needed. It also requires sufficient usability testing to ensure the goal has been met: If a tool or source for information is there on the screen, but users can’t find it, it may as well not even be present.</p>

      <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">The penalty for failing to anticipate is often swift and permanent, particularly if you do not have a captive user, as is the case with public websites and apps, for example. Those users will probably never return from their search. Even if you do have a captive user, you probably don’t have a captive client, and if the client’s employees are wasting time trying to find required resources, your competitors will have a good story to tell when it is time to make their next pitch.</p>
