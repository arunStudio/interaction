	<h4 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Principle: Aesthetic design should be left to those schooled and skilled in its application: Graphic/visual designers</h4>
	<h4 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Principle: Fashion should never trump usability</h4>
	<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Generating artificial obsolescence through fashion is a time-honored and effective way to sell everything from clothing to cars. A new fashion should not and need not detract from user-performance: Enormous visual and even behavioral changes can be carried out that either do not hurt productivity or markedly increase it.</p>

	<h4 class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">Principle: User test the visual design as thoroughly as the behavioral design</h4>
	<p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">User test after aesthetic changes have been made, benchmarking, where applicable, the new design against the old. Ensure that learnability, satisfaction, and productivity have been improved or at least have stayed the same. If not, newly-added aesthetics that are causing a problem need to be rethought.</p>
